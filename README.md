# Algorithms Kitchen

I see that numerous algorithms are discussed and presented wihtin the Algorithm Analysis and Design topic. 
Yet, I have been having difficulty about findind the implementaion of those algorithms such as bruteforce implementation of TSP problem.

In this repository, I presents the implementations of many algorithms in different styles, including 

<ul>
  <li>BruteForce</li>
  <li>Greedy</li>
  <li>Divide and Conquer</li>
  <li>Deacrease by one</li>
  <li>Dynamic Progrmaming</li>
</ul>
